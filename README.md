# CalHub
Super simple Minecraft server network hub plugin for Bukkit/Spigot/Paper

Currently does the following:

+ Prevents dropping/picking up items with bypass permissions
+ Prevents bucket use with bypass permissions
+ Provides custom join, leave, and death messages
+ Spawn management (/setspawn, /spawn)
+ TP to spawn after falling into the void
+ Disables weather changes (can be disabled in the config)
+ Configurable MOTD on join
+ Option to clear chat on join 
+ Option to disable water/lava flow
+ Option to disable "fading" (ice melt, leaf decay, etc.)

ToDo/Requested:
+ Option to disable growth and trampling
